                The LG G7 One is LG’s first foray into Android One and it’s a decent attempt. Those who have tried, 
                or have got, the LG G7 ThinQ will notice the phones are practically the same, except for a few 
                under-the-hood reductions. But this is all about Android One and the clean-cut OS shines on this 
                handset.

                The spec that stood out the most on the G7’s unveiling was its battery size. A 3000mAh cell 
                in a phone with a 1000-nit, quad-HD+ 6.1-inch display was never going to end well. Well, it 
                actually fared better than I’d anticipated – but remains disappointing nonetheless.
                <br><br>
                It was hard to make it through the whole day without the phone requiring a top-up at some 
                point; the G7 often managed less than 4 hours of actual screen-on time. Even the OnePlus 6, 
                which I also found to be lacking in the battery department, managed around 5 hours. An hour 
                of HD Netflix consumed 15%, while an hour of Spotify with the DAC turned on took off 19%.

                There’s support for both types of wireless charging – Qi and PMA – along with fast charging 
                too. That smaller battery does means that the G7 can get up to full power pretty quickly when 
                using the supplied cable and plug.

                On paper, LG appears to have made improvements to the rear camera, loading it with dual Sony IMX351 
                sensors. Specifically, you’ll find 16-megapixel, f/1.6 (OIS) 77-degree main unit and a 16-megapixel 
                f/f1.9, 107-degree secondary sensor on the phone’s rear.
                <br><br>
                The main sensor is on a par with the unit that features in the V30S, but the wide-angle sensor has a 
                higher megapixel count, wider aperture and field of view than its predecessor’s 13-megapixel secondary 
                sensor.

                The finest thing about the camera is that wide-angle sensor. It’s easily the best use of a secondary 
                sensor and far more worthwhile as a zoom or monochrome camera. The photos captured with the wide-angle 
                camera are varied, with it opening up many more shooting options. Landscape shots look great, as do 
                photos taken in stadiums and the like. You do lose some of the low-light quality with this secondary 
                sensor, but I’m still glad of its inclusion.
                <br><br>
                The photos with the regular ‘main’ 16-megapixel camera are decent: detailed, nicely coloured and with 
                good dynamic range. It’s just a shame that there isn’t a massive jump between this and last year’s G6 
                and V30. The main issue seems to be exposure: photos are often too bright and the auto-HDR mode doesn’t 
                do much to improve matters.
