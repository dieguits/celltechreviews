                The Galaxy S10 is a fitting 10th anniversary phone for Samsung and its storied S series.
                It delivers on change with a novel-looking Infinity-O screen so large it displaces the
                front camera, and a triple-lens rear camera that takes ultra-wide photos. Its in-screen
                fingerprint sensor tech should serve you well, while its Wireless PowerShare could serve
                your friends well. That’s a lot of change – just know that it comes at a high price and
                the Galaxy S10e and S10 Plus flank it from both sides of the coin as better options.

                Samsung wants you to take photos at any angle, so the Galaxy S10 has a triple-lens camera
                on back with a 12MP regular lens, 12MP optically zoomed telephoto lens, and a brand new 16MP
                ultra-wide lens.

                We found that the Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus have the same cameras – on the back at least.
                Here's our mix of shots during of month and a half of testing.
                <br/><br/>
                The main S10 camera exhibit punchy, Instagram-ready colors and looks better than the muted photos
                out of an iPhone in most cases. It's one of the best camera phones out now. However, its HDR prowess
                can, at times, blow out bright backgrounds during daytime shots. And lowlight, while good enough,
                does have serious noise reduction to reduce grain. That only leads to a lot of skin smoothing, as if
                you put on beauty mode when you didn't.

                The Galaxy S10 is a deserved 10th anniversary phone for Samsung and its storied S series.
                Its new display type lays out more pixels across less body, the phone has a triple-lens
                camera so you can now take ultra-wide photos, and inside you'll find a bigger battery
                surrounded by beefier specs.
                <br /><br />
                You’ll like all of these powerful features, while your friends will like the new Wireless
                PowerShare perk – it helps them out more than you. The S10 marks an anniversary, but it also
                marks something a bit different among smartphones. It disrupts the sameness of smartphones just
                enough to become a tempting upgrade.
                <br /><br />
                But the real winner this upgrade cycle is the Galaxy S10 Plus – if you can handle the price
                and its lager 6.4-inch screen size. It's an easy choice for us if you're deciding between the two.
                The Galaxy S10 is too expensive (and got the largest price hike this year among Samsung's new phones)
                not to consider the ultimate upgrade. And, if the price of either Samsung phone is giving you
                second thoughts, this is where the cheaper Galaxy S10e plays an important role.
