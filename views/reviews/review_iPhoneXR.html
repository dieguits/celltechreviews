                Of the three iPhones launched in 2018, the iPhone XR is the most impressive of the lot. 
                Not because of the strength of the spec – the iPhone XS is slightly ahead in a lot of areas – but 
                what you're 'saving' by going for this model far outweighs what you're losing. A multitude of colors, 
                very good battery life and a lower price? If you want a new iPhone, check this one out first.

                The design of the iPhone XR is both familiar and novel and for those used to the home button, 
                its loss is going to be quite a jolt. It comes with a benefit though: the iPhone XR is 
                all-screen on the front (bar the notch at the top) and gives you a more striking feel in the 
                hand overall.

                The rounded edges, as mentioned, are still in the same Ive-designed vein, feeling nice to 
                the touch, and the metal back (finished in aluminum and glass, replacing the steel of the 
                iPhone XS pair) also feels premium.
                <br><br>
                The glass on the front of the iPhone XR is meant to be among the strongest in the industry, 
                and it’s the same material as on the iPhone XS – although we should warn you that we managed 
                to either scratch or put a hairline fracture (we're not sure which, as it's so slight) on our 
                iPhone XS within weeks.

                If you’re any kind of seasoned iPhone user, you probably won’t be that impressed by the 
                iPhone XR’s camera. That’s not to say it’s not decent – it’s powerful at times, and often 
                just takes a good snap without much work – but it doesn't really improve the iPhone’s camera 
                story that much.

                <br><br>
                Shorn of the secondary sensor, the iPhone XR’s camera doesn’t quite hit the heights of those 
                on the XS duo – they offer some truly stunning snaps at times, with incredible detail and brightness, 
                and while the XR isn’t that far behind it’s not got the same 'wow' factor.

                Again, there’s nothing really to criticize it for, but we never took a photo that we were truly 
                impressed by and wanted to share.
