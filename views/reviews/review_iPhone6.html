                Apple's done what we all expected - finely balanced its 'S' phone. 3D Touch is a genuine 
                innovation, and the phone works fluidly at nearly every task - but it's very similar to 
                2014's model.

                The iPhone 6S is no longer available from Apple and there are plenty of newer alternatives 
                such as the iPhone XS, but the 6S can still be found in some stores and at a much lower price 
                than it once had. You can also update it to the latest software - iOS 12.

                Apple's iPhone 6S pitch was 'the only thing that's changed is everything', highlighting that 
                it knows this is phone looks an awful lot like the previous model.

                Apple's been hard at work integrating the Force Touch technology from its Watch and new MacBook Pro 
                into the iPhone 6S, but has decided that it needed to give it a new name: 3D Touch.

                In terms of all the changes offered by the new iPhone, this is definitely the one you should 
                pay most attention to. Not just because it's the most multi-faceted, but also because it's 
                the only change that I feel confident in stating will alter the way we use our iPhones forever.

                The camera app on the iPhone 6S is very similar to previous years, with a few small tweaks 
                to add in new features.

                The first is Live Photos, which takes a 1.5 second picture before and after the snap and 
                turns it into a small video you can play to capture the memory. Apple's clearly realised 
                that you can only do so much to enhance the camera in terms of image quality and started 
                to work out how to capture more of the moment you're after.

                <br><br>
                It's hardly a new idea though - although the integration here is impressive and is less 
                onerous than trying to use the Zoe mode on the HTC One series, for instance. The speed with 
                which you can take a photo hasn't diminished either, so you can take multiple pictures in 
                quick succession and the iPhone's A9 processor can work out what needs to be saved to create 
                the Live Photo.

                Viewing them is simple too - when in the gallery just prod the screen harder to activate 3D 
                Touch and the memory will come to life. Apple's demo showed beautiful images of waterfalls 
                and children smiling, and it seemed the option seemed to really capture the warmth of the situation.
